# Sample-Quiz

HTML (index.html):
Started by creating HTML doc with two containers. One to house my timer and score elements and one to house my question/answer sets. 
I also created Start and Next buttons to use in JavaScript to control when the quiz started and navigation forward through the question set. 

CSS (style.css):
Created consistency both header and question containers by adding borders and colors that were the same. 
Created button classes to change button to green color if question is answered correctly and to a red color if the question is answered incorrectly. 

JavaScript (script.js):
Started by creating simple functions based around starting the quiz, showing the questions, and selecting the answers. 
Added a variable that had an array of question/answer sets. 
Added function for timer to start when the start button was clicked and count down from 30.
Added function for scoring to start at 0 then count up by 1 whenever a question is answered correctly.
